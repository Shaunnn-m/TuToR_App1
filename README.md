TuToR App
Description
TuToR is a student-tutor matching app designed to connect students with qualified tutors based on their course needs and availability. The app includes safety features like user verification, a review system, and in-app messaging to ensure secure and convenient interactions between students and tutors.

The app is built using React Native for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. It offers seamless navigation through various sections, such as finding a tutor, booking sessions, and chatting with tutors directly. Our goal is to simplify the process of finding help in academic subjects and make quality education more accessible.
